"The Perfect Match" is a thought-provoking short story that presents a case for cultural imperialism. It explores how our reliance on technology and AI systems can lead to a loss of individuality and control. The story raises important questions about the impact of technology on our lives and the need for balance between progress and preservation of our humanity. It is a must-read for those interested in the intersection of technology and society, and the potential consequences of our increasing dependence on AI systems.

Some Notes --

- Tech extension of hour brain and how it’s impossible to go back
- Tilly as more of a contemplator than an assistant.
- The argument between Sai and Jenny.
    - “she tells you what to like, do you even know what you like anymore?”
    - She tells you what to like, do you even know who you are anymore?
    - Sai’s temptation to ask Tilly for arguments even when arguing against/with Tilly.
- The points raised by the CEO on his visit at Sai’s place.
- First we create/shape and control how tech/building works then it controls/shape us - Churchill
- The Date and the realization.
- Optimal Activity in Youth argument from Tilly and the over-saving issue( how over saving in your youth might lead to regret later in you life)
- The insanity of detecting what the person is typing and talking about from the vibration detection from the keyboard sitting on the same table and vibrations in the window respectively.
- These AI systems are putting us in a bubble where it becomes indistinguishable what you like and what you are made to like(manipulation)? You are fed information what you might like and would mostly conform with? Is there any notion of presenting opposing views that might lead to better satisfaction levels?
- How day by day we become more and more docile and grow more wool for these AI systems to shave.
- “AI systems making creepy and controlling predictions”
- Worst than being free is having a false belief of being free, the case for most first world countries, you’re like frogs in the pot being slowly boiled.

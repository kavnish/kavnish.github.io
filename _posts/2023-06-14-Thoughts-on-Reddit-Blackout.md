An interesting struggle between Mods and the platform. But how are users impacted, what does this protest means for an "Average" Reddit users? How does the latest policy affect the users? How does it even affect Mods? Are third party app really that good relative to reddit app that they would take hassle of this blackout? Or is it about something bigger, about the principles and what the future of decision making of management might be. These were all the questions I had when I first heard of everything that's been going on on reddit these day, "The Black Out".

Maybe it’s just one of many changes they are going to bring to the platforms which might change the power/control centres of the social network. Is it even possible to have a social network where control is not just on in the management’s hand? Should all social network have a moderator council of some sort? How would it affect the platform from the management and user perspective? Moderator are definitely watching the community very closely and might know better about what is best for the users? but are there any checks pull on the power of the moderators? have there been instances where mods have done disastrous deeds for a community? An Average user is obviously oblivious of what is going on, why is going on, “why my search not work”, “why sub private?”. 

I think this instances is an opportunity for us to think about what we want out social networks to look like? Reddit which was already very different from the other social platform which are totally missing this moderator layer altogether. And only platform that offers down vote feature.

Also what is this sudden hunger for profit, thing have been going pretty good like the way it is, why is management ready to sacrifice the soul of reddit for the profits, adherence to moderators which are putting in efforts day in and out to keep it a sane place.

It’s not just about the APP or API.

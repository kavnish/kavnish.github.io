    I am currently working on Music Recommendation Systems for <a href = "https://wynk.in/music"> Wynk Music</a>.
    Deeply interested in everything about music from the business, product, recommendation to Creative side of it
    and of-course the intersection of ML and Music. Currently trying to grasp how the whole industry has evolved over last 
    few decades and ways we create and distribute the music. I am myself dabbling with DAWs lately (and yeah music theory 
    is tough to get hold of).
    <br/><br/>
    I have worked on Real-time Streaming Speech Recognition System at <a href = "https://jiomeetpro.jio.com/home"> Jio</a>, where
    I was part of the AI-COE team lead by <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaileshk/"> Dr. Shailesh Kumar</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    Previously, I attended <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_(BHU)_Varanasi"> IIT BHU </a> for Engineering from 2015-2019.

When Iâ€™m not doing ML, I like walk, workout, read/watch fiction, mess with DAWs.

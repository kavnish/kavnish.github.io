#### Feature Interaction based point-wise re-ranking for Mixes on Wynk

- Already high CTR
- Multiple fallback systems
- Online

#### Content Based Recommender system for Movies

- low data availability setup
- Multiple fallback systems
- Online

#### Realtime Speech Recognition for JioMeet

- Wav2vec2
- Streaming inference using gRPC bi-directional Streaming
- medical domain fine-tuned LM for CTC decoder

#### Telecom Coverage Optimization using Quadratic Programming

- Formulated telecom coverage as a quadratic optimization problem parametrize by the fraction of grids demand served by any cell.
- Solved the program using CVXOPT
- Developed an objective function incorporating the interference/coverge/quality of the demand served
- Trained another model to predict the tilt angle on the cell to serve a given distribution of the demand.

#### Distributed Anomaly Detection

- In-house servers firewall logs were monitored to detect strange connections
- Distributed pipeline on Apache Spark
- Detection was based on KDEs, where appropriate kernels, time-spans, entity levels can be choosen based on the data distribution

#### Mobility Tracing during Covid Migration Patterns using Telecom data

- Covid19 migration patterns between states/cities/GeoHashes
- Distributed pipeline on Apache Spark on Telecom logs

#### Look Alike Modelling in retails

- Modelled User based on a number of attributes captured by the business to find High propensity to buy customers.
- Using Mahlanobis distance

#### Sales prediction using DeepAR model

- Trained DeepAR model on Sales Time series

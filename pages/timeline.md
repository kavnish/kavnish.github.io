`Fun thing I noticesd in TBBT-ep-17 -- Sheldon is portrayed as super smart person but still he's having a hard time learning the mandarin language. writers played that out in a fun way without it feeling sheldon going out of character. -- or maybe it's just me assuming that smart people learn languages quickly.`

`Solved the tab issue by writing a chrome extensions which pushes all my new tabs to the left if active tab is not in a group else it would open it in the group.`

`I don't understand why tab like UIs always have new tab opening on the right side, I think new tabs should always open on the left side that's where it's easier for me atleast (and couple this with chromes limit on number of visible tab buttons in the tab bar, new tabs on the left make even more sense as your new tabs are always visible)`

`AI tools only needed to be as good to pull a significant number of human users/interactions, I think we are past that threshold and AI systems will continue to improve as we use them. (there will be need for other technical augmentations to patch the limitations of transformers though.)`

`Users have different affinities towards different features and if the user specifiers are not made available to the model it becomes diffucult to learn user level sensitivities towards different features. Hand crafting meta level sensitivity features comes handy here but not to total relief as sometimes they are very difficult to craft and excludes unimaginable patterns that you might not have thought about.`

`We looked at similarities between a users collaborative vector and average collaborative vectors of last N played and skipped songs, and the results were not as expected, apparently on a music streaming platform the songs that user skipps are not VERY different from the songs they streamed (>30s), when I think about it, it makes sense as the platform is already personalized to a level and the user only gets to skips the platform thought the user might like, Interesting thing to look at might be what fraction of skipped songs are out of their profile (beyond a threshold) as it tells us alot about how discover exposure does our platform provides. Discover exposure is itself of multiple flavour but that's the topic of another post. (Personalized/Random)`

`Everyone has their own way of using like/stat/bookmark buttons and recsys need to understand it at the user level, You can either train a single model to learn these pattern or individual model for each user former poses the issue of insuring that each user has some representation in the traing data and later poses some operational limitations and weak cross user learning`

`this weekend was all about automations and extenstion on chrome, macos, slack... had a good time exploring applescript, filesaver.js, electron.js, slack SDK, ... ChatGPT makes things a lot easier but it still takes a lot to build something meaningful. This weekend was a good reminder of planning things out first on paper before jumping to code (and you def need a devlog to prevent yourself from all the cool distractions)`

`'The Perfect Match' is a thought-provoking short story that presents a case for cultural imperialism. It explores how our reliance on technology and AI systems can lead to a loss of individuality and control. The story raises important questions about the impact of technology on our lives and the need for balance between progress and preservation of our humanity. It is a must-read for those interested in the intersection of technology and society, and the potential consequences of our increasing dependence on AI systems.`

`Sometimes I find my self liking the song that I liked a long time back and want to make them more discoverable so I re-like them(basically dislike and like them back) to bring them to the top of the like list. I am pretty sure we can figure out a better UX for this situation. Or there should be a way to sort liked song list based on current relevance.`

`audio modality trade-offs information density for higher dimensionality, I believe solving audio efficiently needs a whole another approach that would involve first bringing the dimensionality down to discrete tokens and then learning those tokens auto-regressively. Just that this audio quantization step should be audio segment importance/eventful-ness aware since our ears are sensitive to very ephemeral acoustic events which might not be avery efficiently modelled by current frame based methods.`

`Making something digitally available doesnâ€™t mean it will create new demand? or does it? eg synths?`

`Fun thing I noticed in TBBT-ep-17 -- Sheldon is portrayed as super smart person but still he's having a hard time learning the mandarin language. writers played that out in a fun way without it feeling sheldon going out of character. -- or maybe it's just me assuming that smart people learn languages quickly.`

`Had a six people connect today all from different parts of the organization, one learning was to ask people to hold off questions till the ends or checkpoints if the session in sub 30min. the person presenting must have the control of the session. having a checkpoint in the middle should be enough.`

`writing is hard and therapeutic at the same time and is incomplete without reading what you have written. it takes time to develope a muscle for it.`

`I try to keep a getting-of-the-chair note while working, it makes jumping back into the paused tasks way easier.'`

`People say music bring back memories just like fragrances do sometime, exploring ways to create nostalgic mixes for 50M+ users efficiently.`

`I am so into chrome extensions now that I have an extension to manage manage extensions better.`

**2023-06-28**

`Solved the tab issue by writing a chrome extensions which pushes all my new tabs to the left if active tab is not in a group else it would open it in the group.`

**2023-06-28**

`I don't understand why tab like UIs always have new tab opening on the right side, I think new tabs should always open on the left side that's where it's easier for me atleast (and couple this with chromes limit on number of visible tab buttons in the tab bar, new tabs on the left make even more sense as your new tabs are always visible)`

`conditional-sampling is the new creativity`


**2023-06-24**

`AI tools only needed to be as good to pull a significant number of human users/interactions, I think we are past that threshold and AI systems will continue to improve as we use them. (there will be need for other technical augmentations to patch the limitations of transformers though.)`

`Users have different affinities towards different features and if the user specifiers are not made available to the model it becomes difficult to learn user level sensitivities towards different features. Hand crafting meta level sensitivity features comes handy here but not to total relief as sometimes they are very difficult to craft and excludes unimaginable patterns that you might not have thought about.`

`We looked at similarities between a users collaborative vector and average collaborative vectors of last N played and skipped songs, and the results were not as expected, apparently on a music streaming platform the songs that user skips are not VERY different from the songs they streamed (>30s), when I think about it, it makes sense as the platform is already personalized to a level and the user only gets to skips the platform thought the user might like, Interesting thing to look at might be what fraction of skipped songs are out of their profile (beyond a threshold) as it tells us alot about how discover exposure does our platform provides. Discover exposure is itself of multiple flavour but that's the topic of another post. (Personalized/Random)`

`Everyone has their own way of using like/stat/bookmark buttons and recsys need to understand it at the user level, You can either train a single model to learn these pattern or individual model for each user former poses the issue of insuring that each user has some representation in the traing data and later poses some operational limitations and weak cross user learning`

`this weekend was all about automations and extension on chrome, macos, slack... had a good time exploring AppleScript, filesaver.js, electron.js, slack SDK, ... ChatGPT makes things a lot easier but it still takes a lot to build something meaningful. This weekend was a good reminder of planning things out first on paper before jumping to code (and you def need a dev-log to prevent yourself from all the cool distractions)`

`reddit blackout is not about api pricing, it's for something way more important -- the direction reddit seem to be heading`

`our top priority should be to fine tune LLMs to respond to token limits mentioned in the context`


**2023-06-15**

`LSTMs cells pass both cell, hidden state to the next cell and in a stacked LSTM setup the outputs of the first layer is used as inputs to the corresponding LSTM cells in the next layer (the hidden and cell states are only shared within the layer)`

`'The Perfect Match' is a thought-provoking short story that presents a case for cultural imperialism. It explores how our reliance on technology and AI systems can lead to a loss of individuality and control. The story raises important questions about the impact of technology on our lives and the need for balance between progress and preservation of our humanity. It is a must-read for those interested in the intersection of technology and society, and the potential consequences of our increasing dependence on AI systems.`

`Sometimes I find my self liking the song that I liked a long time back and want to make them more discoverable so I re-like them(basically dislike and like them back) to bring them to the top of the like list. I am pretty sure we can figure out a better UX for this situation. Or there should be a way to sort liked song list based on current relevance.`

### The Diary of a Young Girl [5/5]

#### by Anne Frank

It’s a record of Anger, Suffering, Levity, Romance, Support, and above all Hope — which ends with a betrayal (albeit there’s no mention of it in the Diary). Anne, a Charming, Intelligent, Articulate, Emotional, Self Critical (in the later part of the Diary) girl makes you privy to the raw emotions, rants, stories.  Her longing for someone to confide in. How abandoned she was feeling in the Annexe. It’s vivid description of life in Annexe from a fourteen-year-old’s point of view.

### Exhalation [5/5]

#### by Ted Chiang

The book is well written and transcend through multiple viewpoint of technology from psychology, ethical-dilemmas, spaceships, anthropomorphosis, romance. The story notes section at the end is a peek into the inspirations for all the stories and I feel lucky that I didn't skip it. 

Amazing read.

### Mahagatha: 100 Tales from the Puranas [3.5/5]

#### by Satyarth Nayak

Some Stories are good, and after a time it becomes difficult to keep track of all the characters but author has done a good job of reminding the characters in brief if they appear after a long stretch. All the stories revolves around boons and curses. If you are a fan of hindu mythology especially the Shiva, you will enjoy this book.

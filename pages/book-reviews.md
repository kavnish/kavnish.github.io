### Exhalation [5/5]

#### by Ted Chiang

The book is well written and transcent through multiple viewpoint of technology from psycology, ethical-dilemmas, spaceships, anthropomorphosis, romance. The story notes section at the end is a peek into the inspirations for all the stories and I feel lucky that I didn't skip it. 

Amazing read.

### Mahagatha: 100 Tales from the Puranas [3.5/5]

#### by Satyarth Nayak

Some Stories are good, and after a time it becomes difficult to keep track of all the characters but author has done a good job of reminding the charcters in brief if they appear after a long strech. It all about boons and curses.
Shiva is just amazing.

### The Diary of a Young Girl [5/5]

#### by Anne Frank

In 1941 when German armies invaded Netherlands, Anne Frank and her family went into hiding in a secret annex in Amsterdam. Anne Frank was 13 years old at that time. She started writing a diary in which she recorded her fears, hopes, and experiences during the war which was published in 1947.

The book takes you through the life and outlook of a thirteen year old girl who unlike an average thirteen year old has deep emotional and expressive maturity(at least in writing). If you want to understand how it is like to be a child in an annex, this is the book to read.

### Exhalation [5/5]

#### by Ted Chiang

The book is well written and transcend through multiple viewpoint of technology from psychology, ethical-dilemmas, spaceships, anthropomorphosis, romance. The story notes section at the end is a peek into the inspirations for all the stories and I feel lucky that I didn't skip it. 

Amazing read.

### Mahagatha: 100 Tales from the Puranas [3.5/5]

#### by Satyarth Nayak

Some Stories are good, and after a time it becomes difficult to keep track of all the characters but author has done a good job of reminding the characters in brief if they appear after a long stretch. All the stories revolves around boons and curses. If you are a fan of hindu mythology especially the Shiva, you will enjoy this book.
